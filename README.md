## a quick overview of *me* ##
- 👋 Hi, I’m atheses, a Cuban programmer interested in making the world a better place with code.
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, scripting, and security.
- 🌱 I currently know Python, Bash, Go, and C, though I chiefly use Python.
- 💞️ I’m open to helping out with any projects! (I can even help with translation!)
